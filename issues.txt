For AG granules batches the transaction is turning up as compression for AG granules. 
Can change but adjusting the routing for that item code with same transaction number aas 
compression but change the description to AG granules mandec.  -1 etc turning up as well.


if a interface file is in teh archive folder twice for some reason you will see duplicate transactions for the same work centre
need to add function to check if hte file you are reading has teh same write time and file name as a previously consumed file.
